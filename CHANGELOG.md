## 1.22.0 / 2022-11-09

- Since KubeGems 1.22.0, we had supported the Model Store. User of KubeGems can be download tens of thousands AI models from HuggingFace and OpenMMLab. And they could be successfully run in Kubernetes easily.

- We have released a new project [ModelX](https://github.com/kubegems/modelx), which is a repository for AI models. Model X is based on the design of OCI and Helm Charts. `Modelx Client` makes it easier for developers to package and publish models locally, and `Modelx Server` can be combined with the KubeGems ModelStore to provide more convenient algorithm deployment online service.

  - Download ModelX (https://github.com/kubegems/modelx/releases)

- KubeGems UI support i18n now, 🇨🇳 Chinese(Simplified)、🇭🇰 Chinese(Traditional)、🇺🇸 English 、🇯🇵 Japanese
  More languages support are being translated.
- We use our `kubegems/ingress-nginx-operator` to replace old `kubegems/ingress-nginx-operator` to implement tenantgateway.
- We refactor kubegems observability, like alert channel, feishu alerts(more at `kubegems/alertproxy`) and so on.
